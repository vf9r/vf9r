this is a patching guide for the Roblox clients published between 2006-2009
a few things you need to take into consideration before patching..

you have to understand that the client probably already works as you downloaded it, but there are some things you have to patch if you want a revival or some things to work in your client

you will need the following applications:
resource hacker: https://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/
x64dbg: https://x64dbg.com/ (i am using snapshot_2022-03-26_14-14 on windows)

you can find a list of clients here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lu1Ex6Z6D0TWUmqikrwD6tSDwVPTRze3?usp=drive_link

step 1 | download a client
go to the google drive folder and navigate to the clients section
pick a client between 2007 to 2009 (2007, 2008 or 2009)
for this tutorial i will be using 2007, so if this is your first time, i would recommend that aswell
pick a month, the options given for 2007 (what i am using) are 3/march, 8/august, 11/november, 12/december; i am using august or 8.2007
now download it by right clicking and pressing download, it will take a minute so just wait
once it is downloaded, unzip it to a folder wherever is comfortable, and there you have it: your client of choice

step 2 | prepping debugger
open x32dbg.exe, if you haven't installed it already, then you haven't been paying attention, go back to the top plz
once you are in the debugger (x32dbg) go to the top left where it says file, then open, and locate the Roblox.exe file in your client folder, then open that
you should be met with a lot of random letters and numbers and a lot of different panels, ignore all of that and find the symbols tab in the tab section, the paper with the red dot
double click where it says roblox.exe in the symbols area
at the toolbar above the tabs, find the Aâ‚‚ button and click it, wait for it to load in

step 3 | patching player names (important for revivals)
at the search prompt at the bottom above the progress bar, search for "set a Player's name", there should be 2 responses that look like clones; double click the top one
in the main panel in the middle you should be selected or focused on a line saying push roblox.79B3BC and next to it in orange saying something along the lines of "set a Player's name"
go down one line where it says push and then a number (number may vary by client month or year), select that line and press space
replace 0x1 (or whatever number you have) with 0x0 then press OK, then press cancel if you are stuck on the next line
go to the references tab (same area as symbols tab) and go to the second set a Player's name, and repeat the same process

step 4 | completing patch
press control + P OR go to file at the top left and press patch file
at the bottom right of the patching panel, press Patch File
name it to whatever you want except Roblox obviously, and it MUST end in .exe
you may now close the debugger

step 5 | rebranding and configuring the client (THIS IS TO REBRAND THE CLIENT TO A REVIVAL NAME OR IF YOU JUST WANT TO CHANGE THE TITLES AND PICTURES FROM ROBLOX TO YOUR OWN THING) 
open resource hacker, press the open file button and open your patched client
press the search button and search for files using "Roblox" in them
once done configuring a file, click on the next, it should ask you to compile, so press Compile
the main folders you need to really check are REGISTRY, Menu, String Table, Version Info
when you get to StringTable, 9:1033; replace the line that starts with 132 completely with "132, 	"Images (*.jpg;*.jpeg;*.tga;*.bmp;*.ico;*.png)All Files (*.*)|*.*||""
if you want to change the icon, go to the Icon folder and change the 1033's 1-10 to your icon which should be a .ico file
once done replacing all of the Roblox's with your thing, do CTRL+S or press save in file
you can now close resource hacker

step 6 | testing the client
you can test the client by opening it
if you did step 5 your first look should be at the icons and title (or whichever part you changed) to ensure you did it right
if you have a place/.rbxl file; go ahead and open it, im using "1George's Place (v1)"
the place file must be equivalent or earlier in time frame compared to your client, or marked universal
some places dont have a spawn object so insert one and locate it to wherever you need
go to the command bar at the bottom of your client and run the following commands to playtest

game.Players.LocalPlayer:LoadCharacter()
game.Players:CreateLocalPlayer(0)
game.Players.LocalPlayer:LoadCharacter()

now you should be able to move around however you want!
if you want to chat and use it more in depth as if it was a real game
insert the "NetworkClient" object, and it should automatically fullscreen you and get you the chat and health UIs

you can have fun now goodbye
if there's something inaccurate or something i should add please let me know because i really will not just add things as i go
